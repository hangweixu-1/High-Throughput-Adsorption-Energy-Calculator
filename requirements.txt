# =============================================================
# High-Throughput Adsorption Energy Calculator - Requirements
# =============================================================
# Install:  pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Notes:
#   - GPAW and MACE have heavy dependencies (torch, libxc, etc.)
#     Install only what you need based on your chosen engine.
#   - For GPAW, conda install is often easier than pip.
#   - For GPU support with MACE, install pytorch with CUDA first.
# =============================================================

# --- Core (always required) ---
numpy>=1.22
ase>=3.22                  # Atomic Simulation Environment
pymatgen>=2023.1           # Structure analysis, slab generation, adsorption sites

# --- MACE engine (install if using engine=mace) ---
# Requires PyTorch. Install PyTorch first:
#   CPU:  pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#   CUDA: pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
mace-torch>=0.3.0

# --- GPAW engine (install if using engine=gpaw) ---
# GPAW requires compiled C extensions and libxc.
# Recommended via conda:
#   conda install -c conda-forge gpaw
# Or via pip (needs system libs):
#   pip install gpaw
#   gpaw install-data
# gpaw>=22.8.0

# --- Utilities (usually already installed with above) ---
scipy>=1.7
